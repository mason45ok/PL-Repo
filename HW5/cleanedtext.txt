people would like think chatting horcruxes banned subject hogwarts know dumbledore particularly fierce wo say word sir riddle left harry glimpsed face full wild worn first found sort happiness enhance handsome features made somehow less human thank harry dumbledore quietly let us go harry landed back office floor dumbledore already sitting behind desk harry sat waited dumbledore speak hoping piece evidence long time dumbledore last confirms theory working tells right also far still go harry suddenly noticed every single one old headmistresses portraits around walls awake listening conversation corpulent red nosed wizard actually taken ear trumpet well harry dumbledore sure understood significance heard age give take months tom riddle could find make immortal think succeeded sir asked harry made horcrux die attacked horcrux hidden somewhere bit soul safe bit dumbledore heard voldemort particularly wanted horace opinion would happen wizard created one horcrux would happen wizard determined evade death would prepared murder many times rip soul repeatedly store many separately concealed horcruxc book would given information far know far sure voldemort knew wizard ever done tear soul two dumbledore paused moment marshaling thought four years ago received considered certain proof voldemort split soul asked harry handed harry dumbledore diary riddles diary one giving instructions reopen chamber secrets understand sir harry well although see riddle came described phenomenon never mere memory starting act think mere memory sapping life girl whose hands fallen something much sinister lived inside book fragment soul almost sure diary horcrux raised many questions answered intrigued alarmed diary intended weapon much safeguard still understand harry well worked horcrux supposed work words fragment soul concealed inside kept safe undoubtedly played part preventing death owner could doubt riddle really wanted diary read wanted piece soul inhabit possess else slytherin monster would unleashed well want hard work wasted harry wanted people know slytherin heir could take credit time quite correct dumbledore nodding see harry intended diary passed planted future hogwarts student remarkably blase precious fragment soul concealed within point horcrux professor slughorn explained keep part self hidden safe fling somebody else path run risk might destroy indeed happened particular fragment soul saw careless way voldemort regarded horcrux seemed ominous suggested must made planning make horcruxes loss first would detrimental wish nothing else seemed make sense told two years later night returned body made illuminating statement death eaters gone anybody along path leads told anybody thought knew meant though death eaters referring horcruxes horcruxes plural harry believe wizard ever yet fitted lord voldomort seemed grow less human passing years transformation undergone seemed explainable soul mutilated beyond realms might call evil made impossible kill murdering people harry could make sorcerer stone steal one interested immortality well know tried five years ago n l dumbledore several reasons think sorcerer stone would appeal less horcruxes lord voldemort elixir life indeed extend life must lie drunk regularly eternity drinker maintain immortality therefore voldemort would entirely dependant elixir ran contaminated stone stolen would die like man voldemort likes operate alone remember believe would found thought dependent even elixir intolerable course prepared drink would take horrible condemned attacking regain body thereafter convinced intended continue rely horcruxes would need nothing could regain human form already see close immortal man harry armed information crucial memory succeeded procuring us closer finishing lord voldemort anyone ever heard harry better make stronger soul pieces seven powerfully magical number seven powerfully magical number yes think idea soul would greatly appeal lord voldemort made seven horcruxes harry several portraits walls made similar noises shock mid outrage could anywhere world hidden buried invisible glad see appreciate magnitude problem dumbledore calmly firstly harry seven six seventh part soul however maimed resides inside regenerated body part lived spectral existence many years exile without self seventh piece soul last anybody wishing kill voldemort must attack piece lives body six horcruxes harry little desperately supposed find forgetting already destroyed one destroyed another harry eagerly yes indeed dumbledore raised blackened hand ring harry marvolo ring curse upon forgive lack seemly modesty prodigious skill professor snape timely action returned hogwarts injured might lived tell tale however withered hand seem unreasonable exchange voldemort soul ring longer horcrux find well know many years made business discover much voldemort past life traveled widely visiting places knew stumbled across ring hidden ruin gaunt house

visit ruin might keeping eye open traces magical concealment however congratulate heartily destroyed diary ring right theory soul four horcruxes remain could anything harry could oh tin cans dunno empty potion bottles thinking portkeys harry must ordinary objects easy overlook would lord voldemort use tin cans old potion bottles guard precious soul forgetting showed lord voldemort liked collect trophies preferred objects powerful magical history pride belief superiority determination carve startling place magical history things suggest voldemort would chosen horcruxr care favoring objects worthy honor diary special diary proof hire slytherin sure voldemort considered importance horcruxes harry think know sir guess dumbledore reasons given believe lord voldemort would prefer objects certain grandeur therefore trawled back voldemort past see find evidence artifacts disappeared around locket harry loudly hufflepuff cup yes dumbledore smiling would prepared bet perhaps hand couple fingers horcruxes three four remaining two assuming created total six problem hazard guess secured objects hufflepuff slytherin set track objects owned gryffindor ravenclaw four objects four founders would sure exerted powerful pull voldemort imagination answer whether ever managed find anything ravenclaw confident however known relic gryffindor remains safe dumbledore pointed blackened fingers wall behind sword reposed within glass case think really wanted come back hogwarts sir harry try find something one founders thoughts precisely dumbledore unfortunately advance us much turned away believe without chance search school forced conclude never fulfilled ambition collecting four founders objects definitely two may found three best even got something ravenclaw gryffindor leaves sixth horcrux harry counting fingers unless got think dumbledore think know sixth horcrux wonder say confess curious behavior snake nagini snake harry startled use animals horcruxes well inadvisable dumbledore confide part soul something think move obviously risky business however calculations correct voldemort still least one horcrux short goal six entered parents house killing seems reserved process making horcruxes particularly significant deaths would certainly believed killing destroying danger prophecy outlined believed making sure intending make final horcrux death know failed interval years however used nagini kill old muggle man might occurred turn last horcrux underlines slytherin connection enhances lord voldemorts think perhaps fond anything certainly likes keep close seems amount control even parselmouth harry diary gone ring gone cup locket snake still intact think might horcrux ravenclaw gryffindor admirably succinct accurate summary yes bowing head still looking sir going leaving school correct dumbledore looking long time think perhaps may close finding one hopeful signs harry quickly come help get rid dumbledore looked harry intently moment saying yes think harry thoroughly taken aback oh yes dumbledore smiling slightly think earned right harry felt heart lift good hear words caution protection headmasters around walls seemed less impressed dumbledore decision harry saw shaking heads phineas nigellus actually snorted voldemort know horcrux destroyed sir feel harry asked ignoring portraits interesting question harry believe believe voldemort immersed evil crucial parts detached long feel perhaps point death might aware loss aware instance diary destroyed forced truth lucius malfoy voldemort discovered diary mutilated robbed powers told anger terrible behold thought meant lucius malfoy smuggle hogwarts yes years ago sure would able create horcruxes still lucius supposed wait voldemorts never received voldemort shortly giving diary doubt thought lucius would dare anything horcrux guard carefully counting much upon lucius fear master gone years lucius believed dead course lucius know diary really understand voldemort told diary would cause chamber secrets reopen cleverly enchanted lucius known held portion soul hands would undoubtedly treated reverence instead went ahead carried old plan ends planting diary upon arthur weasleys daughter hoped discredit arthur get rid highly magical object one stroke ah poor lucius voldemorts fury fact threw away horcrux gain fiasco ministry last year would secretly glad safe azkaban moment harry sat thought moment asked horcruxes destroyed voldemort couldbe killed yes think dumbledore without horcruxes voldemort mortal man maimed diminished soul never forget though soul may damaged repair brain magical powers remain intact take uncommon skill power kill wizard like voldemort even without horcruxes got uncommon skill power harry could stop yes dumbledore firmly power voldemort never know harry impatiently love difficulty stopped adding big deal yes harry love dumbledore looked though knew perfectly well harry refrained saying given everything happened great remarkable thing still young understand unusual harry prophecy says dark lord knows means love asked harry feeling little let yes love dumbledore harry never forget prophecy says significant voldemort made told end last year voldemort singled person would dangerous made person would comes dumbledore sounding impatient pointing harry black withered hand setting much store prophecy spluttered harry prophecy means voldemort never heard prophecy would fulfilled would meant anything course ho think every prophecy hall prophecy fulfilled harry bewildered last year one us would kill harry harry voldemort made grave error acted professor trelawney words voldemort never murdered father would imparted furious desire revenge course forced mother die would given magical protection could penetrate course harry see voldemort created worst enemy tyrants everywhere idea much tyrants fear people oppress realize one day amongst many victims sure one rises strikes back voldemort different always lookout one would challenge heard prophecy leapt result handpicked man likely finish handed uniquely deadly weapons essential understand dumbledore standing striding room glittering robes swooshing
